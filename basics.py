# variable: Represents a value that can change.
    # Example: x = 5, y = 10
        # When you print it (Print (x-y)), it will print the value of the variable (which is 5).

# list: A collection of items that can be of different types. Use [] to create a list and "".
    # Example: teachers = ["Wilson", "Dushaun", "Derek"], then print(teachers), if you want a specific item, do print(teachers[specific index])
        # When you print it (Print (teachers)), it will print the list of teachers. 

# set: A collection of unique items, which means no duplicates are allowed. Use {} to create a set.
    # Difference between a list and a set is that a set does not allow duplicates.
        # Example Code: Teachers = {"Wilson A", "Wilson A", "Dushaun", "Derek"}, then print(teachers)
            # When you print: {"Wilson A", "Dushaun"}
